# Smart-Scheduler
Developed a Python-based Process Scheduling Simulator with an interactive inter- face using Tkinter. Implemented four schedul- ing algorithms - FCFS, HPF, RR, and SJFP - al- lowing users to visualize results through an in- tuitive graph. Calculated metrics such as wait- ing time and turnaround time, facilitating per- formance analysis.
